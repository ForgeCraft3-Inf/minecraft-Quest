Alright, hello everyone. Today, I've been working on compiling a list of mods that are useful in the creation of modpacks, such as recipe mods, food mods, world gen mods, and mob mods. I've divided the mods into various categories so that anyone can have an easier time viewing them. As well, feel free to take a look at Jadedcat's Foundation mods for even more mods available for use. There are several redundant mods in this list, but it's up to you which format you like the most, and which one to use. If there's anything you feel should be on this list, feel free to tell me.

This mod adds a questing book which can be used to create a variety of quests with various tasks and rewards. It adds a reputation system and reward bags that can be configured however you like. As well, it adds several blocks to the game that can be used to track quest progress with redstone, or gates that will only open when a quest is completed.

Lore Expansion:
This mod adds a lore book which can be filled with a variety of lore pages. Each page can be created in a custom JSON system in the mod's config folder. Pages can be read aloud by a narrator and even execute commands when found. These pages can be added to world generation with loot mods or given as rewards in other mods.
